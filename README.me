Vagrant for The Pentesters Framework (PTF)
===

This is a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs) file which sets up a Debian based [PTF](https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf) Virtual Machine.

It currently installs _all_ tools, configuration options coming soon but for now you can edit provision.sh if you'd like to adjust the install. Total size with all tools installed is ~24G.

It sets up the networking as a bridged interface.

It should work across Virtualbox, VMWare and Parallels.

Create:

```
vagrant up
```

You will be prompted to select an interface.

Destroy:

```
vagrant destroy
```

See the Vagrant and PTF docs for further usage info.
